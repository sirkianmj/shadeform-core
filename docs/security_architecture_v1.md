# Shadeform Archive: Cryptographic & Architectural Security Framework
**Version:** 1.0 | **Author:** Kian [Last Name] | **Date:** December 2025

## 1. Abstract
The Shadeform Archive project proposes a novel paradigm in critical infrastructure security: "Architectural Cryptography." By integrating physical material entropy with a Threshold Cryptography scheme, we resolve the paradox between comprehensive surveillance and individual privacy. This document details the mathematical and logical foundations of the system.

## 2. Section A: The Core Philosophy
### 2.1 The "Cold Wallet" Building
In cybersecurity, a "Cold Wallet" is a storage system disconnected from the network to prevent unauthorized access. We apply this concept to physical architecture. The building captures data (surveillance), but this data is immediately encrypted and "taken offline" cryptographically. 

Unlike traditional "Transparent" systems (Option A) or "Anonymous" systems (Option B), the Shadeform Archive treats privacy and security as coupled variables. The building stores "secrets" (identities) that are mathematically impossible to retrieve without the consensus of three distinct entities.

## 3. Section B: The Threshold Model (Option C)
The core of our security is a **3-Layer Threshold Cryptography** model. Identity recovery is not a single action but a multi-party computation.

### 3.1 The Three Keys
1.  **Layer 1: The Entity ID ($K_{AI}$)**
    *   Generated by the building's local AI upon entry.
    *   Based on behavioral metrics (Gait, Heatmap).
    *   *Nature:* Ephemeral & Anonymous. (e.g., `Entity-X-2025`).
2.  **Layer 2: The Warrant Token ($K_{Judge}$)**
    *   A cryptographic token issued via Smart Contract by a judicial authority.
    *   *Nature:* Time-bound (expires in 72 hours) and specific to a requested timeframe.
3.  **Layer 3: The Identity Decryption Key ($K_{Admin}$)**
    *   Held physically by the Archive Director/Admin.
    *   *Nature:* Hardware-based (HSM).

### 3.2 The Mathematical Logic
Let $I$ be the true identity of an individual.
Let $E$ be the encryption function and $D$ be the decryption function.

The system stores the encrypted data $C$:
$$ C = E(I, K_{AI} \oplus K_{Judge} \oplus K_{Admin}) $$

To recover identity $I$, the decryption function $D$ requires all three keys simultaneously:
$$ I = D(C, K_{Total}) $$
$$ \text{Where } K_{Total} \rightarrow (K_{AI} \land K_{Judge} \land K_{Admin}) $$

If any key is missing (e.g., no warrant issued), the decryption fails, yielding only random noise. This ensures that even if the building is hacked, the attacker cannot reveal identities without the external judicial key.

## 4. Section C: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF)
We utilize the entropy of construction materials to generate cryptographic salts, ensuring digital security is anchored in physical reality.

### 4.1 Methodology
1.  **Input:** High-resolution scan of granite or wood grain ($S_{raw}$).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** An algorithm extracts micro-features (pore distribution, vein patterns) into a vector $V$.
3.  **Hashing:** A SHA-256 hash function converts the vector into a 256-bit key.
    $$ Key_{PUF} = \text{SHA-256}(V(S_{raw})) $$

### 4.2 Hypothesis
We posit that the "Material Entropy" of natural stone (Chaos) exceeds the pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) capabilities of standard CPUs, making these physical keys theoretically un-cloneable.

## 5. Section D: Adversarial Defense
### 5.1 Geometric Defense (Anti-FR)
To protect against unauthorized external surveillance (drones), the building facade utilizes a **Ray-Tracing Lattice**. 
*   **Concept:** The lattice geometry is calculated to scatter incoming light rays at specific angles.
*   **Effect:** While the human eye perceives a transparent pattern, Computer Vision algorithms (like YOLO or ArcFace) perceive "noise" or fragmented features.
*   **Target Metric:** Reduce Facial Recognition confidence from $>98\%$ to $<3\%$.

### 5.2 Privacy-Preserving Gait Analysis
Internal monitoring relies on **Non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** sensors.
*   **Input:** Pressure sensors in the floor + Thermal imaging.
*   **Analysis:** The system analyzes *behavioral anomalies* (running, loitering, unauthorized access) rather than *biometric identity*.
